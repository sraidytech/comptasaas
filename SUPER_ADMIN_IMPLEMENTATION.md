# Super Admin Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Super Admin functionality in the SRACOM_COMPTA_MANAGEMENT system.

## Overview

The Super Admin role is a system-wide administrator with unrestricted access across all tenants. The Super Admin can manage tenants, users, declaration types, livre types, and system settings.

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema

The database schema has been updated to support the comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system. Key changes include:

- Enhanced `User` model with optional `tenantId` to allow Super Admins to exist without being tied to a specific tenant
- Expanded `Role` and `Permission` models with many-to-many relationships
- Added `CustomRole` model for tenant-specific roles
- Added `PermissionCategory` enum to organize permissions
- Added audit logging for permission changes

### Admin Module

A new `AdminModule` has been created to handle Super Admin functionality:

- `AdminService`: Provides dashboard statistics and system health information
- `TenantsService`: Manages tenants in the system
- `RolesService`: Manages roles and their permissions
- `PermissionsService`: Manages permissions and user-permission assignments
- `DeclarationTypesService`: Manages declaration types
- `LivreTypesService`: Manages livre types

### Super Admin Guard

A `SuperAdminGuard` has been implemented to restrict access to Super Admin routes. This guard checks if the user has the `SUPER_ADMIN` role before allowing access.

### Tenant Isolation

The `TenantIsolationMiddleware` has been updated to allow Super Admins to bypass tenant isolation, enabling them to access data across all tenants.

## Frontend Implementation

### Admin Dashboard

A new admin dashboard has been created for Super Admins with the following features:

- Overview of system statistics
- Tenant management
- User management
- Declaration type management
- Livre type management
- Role and permission management
- System settings

### Navigation

A dedicated admin navigation component has been created to provide easy access to all Super Admin features.

### Tenant Management

The tenant management interface allows Super Admins to:

- View all tenants in the system
- Create new tenants
- Edit existing tenants
- View tenant statistics

## Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a sophisticated permission system that combines role-based access control with granular permission assignments:

### Core Roles

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**
   - System-wide administrator with unrestricted access
   - Can manage all tenants, users, and system configurations
   - Not bound by tenant isolation

2. **ADMIN (Tenant Administrator)**
   - Full administrative access within their assigned tenant
   - Can manage all users within their tenant
   - Cannot access data from other tenants

3. **TEAM_MANAGER**
   - Manages a team of employees within a tenant
   - Can view and manage client records assigned to their team
   - Limited administrative capabilities

4. **EMPLOYEE**
   - Basic user role for regular staff members
   - Access limited to specifically assigned client records
   - No administrative capabilities

### Custom Roles

The system supports the creation of custom roles with specific permission sets, allowing tenant administrators to create specialized roles tailored to their organizational structure.

### Permission Categories

Permissions are organized into logical categories:

1. User Management Permissions
2. Client Record Management Permissions
3. Declaration Management Permissions
4. Livre Management Permissions
5. Document Management Permissions
6. Task Management Permissions
7. Reporting Permissions
8. System Configuration Permissions

## Next Steps

1. Implement user management for Super Admins
2. Create interfaces for declaration type and livre type management
3. Implement role and permission management interfaces
4. Add system settings configuration
5. Implement audit logging for Super Admin actions
